# Advanced Help

The Advanced Help module allows module developers to store their help outside
the module system, in pure .html or .md (MarkDown) files. It provides a
framework that allows module and theme developers to integrate help texts in a
Drupal site, as well as exposing help to site administrators through the
administrative interface.

- For a full description of the module visit the
  [project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/advanced_help).
