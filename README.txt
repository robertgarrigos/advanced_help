Introduction
------------

The **Advanced help** module provides a framework that allows module
and theme developers integrate help texts in a Drupal site.

For more documentation, please visit: /admin/help/ah/advanced_help
after enabling the module.

Requirements
------------

This module has no required dependencies outside of Drupal core.


Recommended modules
-------------------

Advanced help hint:
  https://www.drupal.org/project/advanced_help_hint
  If Advanced help is not enabled, this module will generate a hint
  string that can be used in the project's hook_help to hint that
  Advanced help should be enabled.


Installation
------------

Install the Advanced Help module as you would normally install a
contributed Drupal module. See
https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for
further information.


Configuration
-------------

There is no configuration.

When you enable the module, you will have access to on-screen help,
including README-files, created to tie in with the **Advanced help**
framework.


Support status
--------------

Reported bugs for the Drupal 7 branch will be fixed in a timely
manner.  Older versions are no longer supported.

Community support in the form of patches are very welcome for both
Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 versions. For QA, the project needs community
support in the form of reviews of patches, development versions and
releases.

The primary goal of the module is to remain light-weight and simple.
This means that not all feature requests will be implemented, even if
they are a good idea.  Feature requests accompanied by patches are
more likely to make it into a release.

The maintainer hopes that the community is willing to help out by
answering &amp; closing support requests.
